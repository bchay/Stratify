# Stratify

This is a project created for an AP Statistics teacher at my High School. It allows a user to input data that can then be sampled using stratification sampling.

## Getting Started
Data can be entered into the spreadsheet. Then, you are able to select the response and stratify variables. Samples can be drawn, and histograms and statistics associated with the samples will appear. Data sets can be saved for future use.

### Installing

You can use this program by going to [Stratify](https://github.com/bchay/stratify), or running your own version of the code. For the latter option, either clone the repository or download and unzip the code. Simply click the green button that says "Clone or download".
