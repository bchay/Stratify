This project allows a user to input data that can then be sampled using stratified sampling. Random samples can be drawn from the population, and users can stratify the data based upon a particular variable.

## Getting Started
Data can be entered into the spreadsheet. Then, you are able to select the response and stratify variables. Samples can be drawn, and histograms and statistics associated with the samples will appear. Data sets can be saved for future use.

### Installing

You can use this program by going to [Stratify](bchay.github.io/Stratify), or running your own version of the code. For the latter option, either clone the repository or download and unzip the code. Simply click the green button that says "Clone or download". Open the index.html file.
